      <h2>* Use of Low-Code or No-Code AI</h2>
      <span>In 2023, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will leave behind its technical jargon to embrace easy drag-and-drop
        interfaces, giving rise to no-code AI. Everyone uses computers now without having to understand the background
        programming of operating systems. Similarly, AI operations and solutions will become more functional without
        coders having to write a single line of code. Its increasing acceptance among laypeople will only allow more
        industries to fully leverage the power of AI-based intelligence and create smarter products. No-code AI has
        already seeped into the market with its user-friendly interfaces in varied domains such as retail and website
        development.</span>

      <h2>* Curated Interactions like ChatGPT</h2>
      <span>
        One of the most sensational upcoming trends in the tech industry is ChatGPT. It has created a furor in the world
        of automated chatbots with its seamless GPT3 technology—the autoregressive language model which gives AI
        ‘human-like capabilities’ to understand and produce texts. Furthermore, with the help of deep learning, ChatGPT
        can generate images from text prompts, solve mathematical equations, and deliver a host of writing tasks ranging
        from finding clever video titles to writing poetry. Its creator, OpenAI, claims that the ChatGPT algorithm is
        trained to answer follow-up questions, understand its mistakes based on feedback, and challenge incorrect
        assumptions.

      <h2>* Marketing in the Metaverse</h2>
      <span>
        A 2021 Bloomberg analysis states that the metaverse market will reach a staggering $800 billion by 2024. The
        metaverse is a 3D virtual simulation where people can interact with one another via multiple platforms. In the
        reign of Internet 3.0, advertisers will realize the endless marketing possibilities of this immersive
        experience, making it the hotbed of brand awareness and engagement. Brands such as Nikeland are already tracking
        consumption choices and patterns in their metaverse stores with different kinds of AI and Virtual Reality- (VR-)
        powered experiences. Others too are seeking to expand user experience by connecting their physical stores to the
        metaverse via QR codes.

      <h2>* Digitally Immune Systems</h2>
      <span>
        A list of tech trends 2023 is incomplete without the introduction of the Digital Immune System (DIS). This
        system refers to an entire architecture of practices borrowed from software design, automation, development,
        operations, and analytics. It aims to mitigate business risks by neutralizing defects, threats, and system
        vulnerabilities to enhance the overall customer experience. The importance of DIS lies in automating the
        different elements of a software system so that it successfully fends off virtual threats of all kinds. Gartner
        predicts that by 2025, companies already deploying DIS will decrease customer downtime by about 80%.

      <span>
        A 2021 PRNewsWite report estimated the hyper-automation market share to grow to $26.5 billion by 2028, while a
        Salesforce report predicts at least 80% of organizations worldwide will move toward hyper-automation to optimize
        productivity and improve customer satisfaction. Hyper-automation is a crucial mix of all the latest tools of
        innovation such as:

      <h2>* Growth of Green Technologies</h2>
      <span>
        Robert Alters, the global head of BBVA Open Innovation—a blockchain innovation company—says, “There are two
        megatrends, decarbonization and technological disruption, that have the potential to transform all industries.”
        This statement confirms the significance of green technologies as being among the top 2023 tech trends. In 2021
        alone, climate tech startups raised nearly $40 billion to address the effects of climate change. From the
        large-scale conversion of industries into their cleaner counterparts (electricity) to the invention of renewable
        energy sources such as green hydrogen—green technologies will dominate the interrelated worlds of industries and
        innovation.

      <h2>* The Rise of Edge and Quantum Computing
      </h2>
      <span>
        A 2022 ReportLinker article estimates a sharp 21.6% growth in the edge-computing market between 2021 and 2028. Edge computing is a programming paradigm that captures, stores, and processes data within the data source instead of in a centralized server environment. This decentralized process brings insights closer to the actual point of interaction and enables the machine to analyze raw data in real time. Edge computing is everywhere, from smartwatches to computers watching intersectional traffic flow. However, the tech trends of 2023 could witness its radical implementation across the data analytics industry

        <h2>* Digital Twins to Bridge the Gap Between the Digital and Physical Worlds</h2>
        <span>
          Hyper-automation has initiated a host of 2023 tech trends, one of which is the application of digital twins, which refers to virtual representations of real-world entities. The ubiquity of different data points has generated the demand among data scientists to virtually observe changes in real-life events and processes by feeding machines with a wealth of information. Cloud providers have already launched significant digital twin infrastructures such as Microsoft’s digital twin on-ramp or Google’s Digital Supply Chain to optimize logistics and manufacturing. A 2022 Grand View Research report projects a whopping 37.5% compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2030, highlighting the increasing relevance of digital twins in the daily operations of industries.
